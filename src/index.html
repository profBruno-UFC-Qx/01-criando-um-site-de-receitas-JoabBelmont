  <h1>Fettucini Alfredo</h1>
  <p>
    This authentic recipe is simple but very delicious, some people add too
    many ingredients to this, but, in this case, less is more.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb fettuccine noddles, dry</li>
    <li>12 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>6 oz Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, freshly grated</li>
    <li>½ - 1 tbsp salt (to taste)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with water and heat it over high heat until boiling.
        Once the water boils, add a good dash of salt and the noodles. Cook only
        until al dente, 9-10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta heats, gently melt the butter over medium heat in a
        large, non-stick skillet with high sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the pasta (reserving the water) and transfer the pasta to the
        skillet with the melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a ½ tbsp salt and toss the pasta with a tongs to combine (nonstick,
        silicone tongs work best).
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium low. Add a handful of grated cheese and a
        ladle of hot pasta water, tossing the pasta continuously with your tongs
        to incorporate the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add more cheese, a little at a time, tossing between each addition,
        until all the cheese has been used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add more hot pasta water as needed to melt the cheese so that it coats
        the noodles (But, be careful not to add too much. You don't want a
        watery sauce).
      </li>
      <li>Taste the pasta and adjust the salt as necessary.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      It is important to use a good quality cheese for this recipe. The cheese
      is the star of the show, so it needs to be good! Also, be sure to use a
      good quality pasta. The pasta and cheese are the only ingredients, so they
      need to be good. You can add some freshly ground black pepper at the end
      as well.
